# U.S. Police Shootings Analysis Dashboard
In an era where police accountability and transparency are paramount, this project delves into the dynamics of U.S. police shootings from 2015 to September 2022. The lack of comprehensive, official statistics on police use of force underscores the importance of independent analysis. This interactive Tableau dashboard aims to shed light on incidents involving law enforcement, providing insights into demographics, circumstances, and geographic patterns.

As society grapples with questions of justice, equity, and policing, this project seeks to contribute to the ongoing conversation by offering a data-driven exploration of police shootings in the United States. By fostering awareness and initiating discussions, we aim to encourage a more informed and engaged dialogue surrounding law enforcement practices.

## Insights
Explore key findings derived from the U.S. Police Shootings Analysis Dashboard:
1. **Signs of Mental Illness:**
   - Nearly a quarter of all police shooting cases involve victims showing signs of mental illness. This emphasizes the intersection of law enforcement encounters with individuals experiencing mental health challenges.
2. **Body Camera Usage:**
   - Alarmingly, over 80% of all police shooting incidents occurred when police officers had their body cameras turned off. This raises questions about accountability and the role of technology in ensuring transparency during such encounters.
3. **Demographic Analysis:**
   - A significant majority of shooting victims are men, with a notable proportion being white. It's crucial to note that this demographic distribution may be influenced by the overall population composition, highlighting the importance of considering national demographics when interpreting such statistics.
4. **Geographic Patterns:**
   - The heatmap illustrates that a concentration of police shootings occurs on the eastern side of the United States. Notably, many incidents in the southern region are clustered near California. This geographical insight prompts further exploration into regional dynamics and potential contributing factors.
5. **Weaponry Distribution:**
   - The data reveals that incidents involving victims with guns far exceed any other type of weapon in police shootings. This emphasizes the prevalence of firearms in such encounters and warrants a closer examination of the role of firearms in policing.

These insights offer a glimpse into the complex dynamics of U.S. police shootings. Use the provided filters and visualizations to delve deeper into each aspect and gain a comprehensive understanding of the data.
